## JWT Vulnerability
1. You need to store the token somewhere on client side and then send it in the header of every request. How you put it in the header depends on the library you are using to perform HTTP requests. For example, if you use python requests library, here are the docs. 

However, this can still create some security vulnerabilities if your token is stolen (in a CSRF attack, for example). What I do is to let the token have a very short lifetime (let's say, some seconds) and demand a new token on a background thread whenever the old token is close to expire. But of course you need to take care with concurrent access to the token (with mutexes, for example).
